    A core line of research in the group is the development of computational methods for the accurate assignment of environmental DNA (eDNA) samples.  
For example, we have previously developed phylogenetic-based methods for clustering diverse sequences implemented in the 
<a href="https://github.com/lpipes/AncestralClust">AncestralClust</a>. We have also developed <a href="https://github.com/lpipes/tronko">tronko</a>
which is a fast approximate likelihood method for phylogenetic assignment of DNA sequences. tronko is the core algorithm behind <a href="https://www.ednaexplorer.org/">
 eDNA Explorer</a>, which is a platform for sharing, exploring, and analyzing data from projects that use environmental DNA.

    Over the past 15 years we have developed a number of statistical and computational
    tools used in analyses and interpretations of NGS data.  Many of the methods are made
    available to other researchers in the <a href="http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/ANGSD">ANGSD</a> package.
    These methods are designed for non-model organisms for which imputation-based genotype calling is unreliable
    or impossible.  Instead, we model the uncertainty in the genotype calls using genotype likelihoods and
    incorporate genotype uncertainty in downstream analyses.  This approach allows researchers to leverage
     inexpensive low-coverage sequencing data for advanced population genetic analyses.

    <h1>Human Genetic Diversity and Disease</h1>
    <hr style="height:3px;border:none;color:#808088;background-color:#808088;" />

    Most human genetic studies have focused on European and other highly represented populations.
     However, much of human genetic and phenotypic variation is not represented in this group.
     Focusing primarily on Europeans limits our ability to provide equal medical treatment for all
     population groups.  Furthermore, understudied populations harbor variants not commonly found in
      Europeans that can help provide a better understanding of disease etiology for the benefit of all.
     My group has specialized in analyzing genetic variation in understudied groups, including Inuit
     from Greenland, Tibetans, Aboriginal Australians, Native Americans, and other groups.  For example,
      we have shown that Tibetans harbor unique genetic variants that modulate the regulation of erythropoiesis
      to avoid mis-regulation in high altitude.  We have also shown that these variants were transferred to
      Tibetans by interbreeding with extinct hominids called ‘Denisovans’.
      In studies of Aboriginal Australians we have identified unique genetic adaptations associated with
      thyroid function, likely related to thermal regulation.  In Inuit from Greenland, we have identified
       mutations that alter the regulation of fatty acid desaturase (FADS) genes, thereby decreasing the endogenous
        synthesis of certain poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to compensate for a high dietary intake of these fatty acids.

                   Much of our previous work has focused on developing computational methods to elucidate
                    evolutionary changes in DNA or in phenotypes such as expression levels, along the branches
                     of evolutionary trees. We are now using similar computational techniques to elucidate
                     processes along the branches of cell lineage trees within an individual.  The process of
                      differentiation of cells during ontogeny/morphogenesis can be described by a tree, much
                      like an evolutionary tree.  Similarly, the process of mutation and cell differentiation
                       driving carcinogenesis can be described as an evolutionary process acting within an individual
                       in which the unit of evolution is a cell instead of an individual.  A new line of research in
                       the lab is the modeling and analysis of somatic mutations.
                       We have worked with <a href="http://www.bx.psu.edu/makova_lab/">Kateryna Markova</a> on
                       analyzing mitochondrial heteroplasmies and on developing probabilistic models of the spread of
                        somatic mutations during ontogenesis.  These models allow us to take advantage of large
                        NGS data sets to test hypotheses regarding differential proliferation of mutations in different
                         tissues and on natural selection acting on the population of cells within an individual.
                          We are also working on modeling single-cell sequencing data from tumors to provide better
                          computational methods for analyzing tumor evolution.
