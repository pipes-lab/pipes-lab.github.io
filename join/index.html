    <h1>Undergraduate Students</h1>
    <hr style="height:1px;border:none;" />

We welcome undergraduate students interested in pursuing mentored research in our lab. 
The ideal student should have a basic understanding of biology and some programming skills, such as proficiency in Python. 
However, we understand that students may come from diverse backgrounds, so we encourage those who are passionate and eager to learn 
to reach out.

For biology students who want to strengthen their programming or statistical skills, we recommend starting with courses 
like ICS111 (Introduction to Computer Science I), MATH471 (Probability), and MATH472 (Statistical Inference). For students 
with a background in computer science or statistics who wish to gain foundational knowledge in biology, we suggest 
exploring BIOL375 (Genetics) and BIOL650 (Population Genetics).

Courses like MATH305 (Mathematical Modeling: Probabilistic Models) can provide valuable skills for research in our lab. 
There are also free online resources and boot camps available to help you build these skills. Please feel free to contact us 
if you have any questions about preparation or recommended resources.
