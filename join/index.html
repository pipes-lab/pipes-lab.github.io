We are seeking new postdocs and graduate students in all areas of research, but we are particularly interested in researchers with a strong background in computation and statistics and interested in methods development.

    <h1>Undergraduate Students</h1>
    <hr style="height:1px;border:none;" />
We welcome undergraduate students interested in pursuing mentored research.  The ideal student should be familiar with basic biology, be able to program well in at least one language such a Python.  It is usually difficult for us to find suitable projects for students interested in biology but with no statistical or computational training.
