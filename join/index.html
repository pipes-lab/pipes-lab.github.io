    <h1>Postdoctoral fellows and Graduate students</h1>

We are seeking new postdocs and graduate students in all areas of research, but we are particularly interested in researchers with a strong background in computation and statistics and interested in methods development.  

## Undergraduate Students

We welcome undergraduate students interested in pursuing mentored research.  The ideal student should be familiar with basic biology, be able to program well in at least one language such a Python.  It is usually difficult for us to find suitable projects for students interested in biology but with no statistical or computational training.
