The Pipes Lab website was designed by <a href="/team/lenore-pipes">Lenore Pipes</a> building on the excellent foundation provided by <a href="https://nielsen-lab.github.io/team/andrew-vaughn/">Andrew Vaughn</a>, who designed the <a href="https://nielsen-lab.github.io/">Nielsen Lab website</a>. The Pipes Lab website builds on the template originally created by Trevor Bedford for [his lab website](http://bedford.io). See [this page](https://bedford.io/misc/about/) for information about using Trevor's template.  We also incorporated design elements and code from several labs that have adapted Trevor's template, including the [Nielsen Lab](https://nielsen-lab.github.io/), [Riggleman Lab](http://rrgroup.seas.upenn.edu/), the [Drummond Lab](http://drummondlab.org/), and the [Canepa Lab](https://caneparesearch.org/).

If you find any errors in this website (broken links, images not displaying, typos, etc.), feel free to report them to <a href="/team/lenore-pipes">Lenore</a> so she can correct them. The source code for the Pipes Lab website is freely available [here](https://github.com/pipes-lab/pipes-lab.github.io), under the MIT license, and we encourage its use for your own projectsâ€”though a citation would be appreciated!
