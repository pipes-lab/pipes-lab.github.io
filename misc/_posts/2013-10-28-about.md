The Pipes Lab website was designed by <a href="/team/lenore-pipes">Lenore Pipes</a> building on the excellent foundation provided by <a href="https://nielsen-lab.github.io/team/andrew-vaughn/">Andrew Vaughn</a>, who designed the <a href="https://nielsen-lab.github.io/">Nielsen Lab website</a>. The Pipes Lab website builds on the template originally created by Trevor Bedford for [his lab website](http://bedford.io). See [this page](https://bedford.io/misc/about/) for information about using Trevor's template.  We also incorporated design elements and code from several labs that have adapted Trevor's template, including the [Nielsen Lab](https://nielsen-lab.github.io/), [Riggleman Lab](http://rrgroup.seas.upenn.edu/), the [Drummond Lab](http://drummondlab.org/), and the [Canepa Lab](https://caneparesearch.org/).

We extend our sincere thanks to Petra Korlevic for her beautiful illustrations featured on our website. Her artwork brings life and character to our lab’s online presence. You can reach out to Petra at pkorlevic@gmail.com or find her on X (formerly Twitter) @petrathepostdoc.
